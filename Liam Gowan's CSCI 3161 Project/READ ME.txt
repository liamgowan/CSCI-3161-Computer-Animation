Description: This is a C program that uses OpenGL to create a flight 
simulator. The program reads in a .txt file and builds and colours a plane
out of it. The altitude of the plane can be changed by using the up and 
down keys. The speed of the plane can be changed by using page up and page
down, however they plane cannot move at a speed of less than 0.05. The 
propeller speed moves with the speed of the plane. By pressing the 's' key, 
you can toggle between a sea/sky view and a grid view mode. The sea and sky
are a disk and cylinder, respectively, that have a .PPM texture wrapped 
around them. Wire frame and solid rendering can be toggled by pressing 'w'.
By pressing 'f', you will switch between full screen and windowed mode. 
Pressing 'q' will quit the program. You can move the camera left and right
depending on where your cursor is. Lighting has been used in this project
to make things look 3D. Fog on the ocean can be toggled by pressing the 'b'
key. This program does create mountains that are made from streched cylinders 
in the shape of cones. The mountain texturing can be toggled using 't', and
the mountains can be toggled themselves by pressing 'm'.

Bonus: The bonus parts are as follows: By pressing 'a', a bomb will drop 
from the plane and when it gets to y=0, the sea will flash red. By pressing
'v' the plane will engage in a vertical take off. By pressing 'n', the 
plane will nose dive. By pressing 'c', the plane will spin out of control 
and when y=0 the program will exit. Pressing 'd' toggles a sunset. Pressing
'i' toggles a Great Britain plane insignia. Pressing 'd' will draw missiles 
on the wings. Pressing 'o' will shoot the missiles, and once they have reached 
a certain distance they will then respawn back on the wings. Also, when the 
altitude is changing, the plane will tilt on the z axis appropriately.

Note: This program uses some ideas discussed from the course website.
It also uses .txt and .ppm files found on the project page.
